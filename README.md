# Checkers

## "Software Design" course work - Vilnius Tech

A game of checkers for two players.


# Checkers Version

Given the [available versions of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts), one of the versions has to be chosen for implementation. 

The implementation should support a relatively simple swap of the rulesets, allowing to easily implement other versions of the game without rewriting most of the underlying code.

The chosen implementation is [English draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts).
