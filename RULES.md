# Rules of English Draughts

## Starting position
* Played on 8x8 board
* End rows are called kings rows
* Each player starts with 12 pieces, 
  occupying the first three rows closes to the individual player

## Moves
* Simple - move the piece diagonally to an unoccupied cell
    * Regular pieces can only go diagonally forwards
    * King pieces can go in any diagonal direction
* Jump - move the piece diagonally over an opponent's piece to an unoccupied 
  cell directly beyond and in the same direction of the opponents' piece
    * Regular pieces can only jump diagonally forwards
    * King pieces can jump in any diagonal direction
    * Jumping is mandatory, if available
    * If there are multiple ways that the player can jump, the player has to choose 
    which piece they want to jump 
    * Jumped pieces are considered captured and are removed from the game.
* Multiple jumps can be done if after a jump there is another piece that can be jumped.

## Kings
* If a piece reaches kings row it turns into a king and gains an ability to move
  and jump diagonally backwards
* If a piece reaches kings row the move is finished (even if the piece would be elligible
  for a jump after becoming king)
    
## End of game
* Player wins if they capture all of the enemy pieces
* Draw if the opponent has no legal backend.moves or if players agree to a draw
